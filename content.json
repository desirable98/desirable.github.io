Problem 1: Implement a simple RISC Core (2+5+8=15 Points) On class, we define an extremely simple RISC ISA and its hardware organization, which are both shown below. For this homework assignment, we need to design/implement/simulate this core. Problem(a)Which HDL you want to use ? Solution(a)System Verilog Problem(b)For Verilog-players, please write an top-level structural verilog file to decribe the system. For C-players, please complete a header filer and .cc file , compatible to Vivado HLS, to describe the system. (Hint: Please submit your script as well) Solution(b)In the attachment I submitted, The tb-top.v is my testbench, and top.v is the top file of the whole core mudule, including 5 subfiles for circuit sub-module. You can run testbench.v file to get the simulated waveform. I also submitted the waveform file, whose screencut at the bottom of the document. Problem(c)For Verilog-players, please write a testbench verilog file to simulate the system. It should complete a 4-MAC (neuron) computing. For C-players, please complete a test.cc file , compatible to Vivado HLS, to simulate the system. It should complete a 4-MAC (neuron) computing. (Hint: Please submit your script and simulated waveform, highlight the final results and compare it with the theoretical value.)

At first I stored the calculating data(int16) in dmem, and the instructions in imem at the at the initial of simulation. And part of addresses were stored in register file.In each cycle, I loaded the data from dmem and calculated them. We also need an extra instruction to reset the psum register. At the end of cycle, the sum was restored in dmem, and the address was just we prestore in the rf(rs in assemble codes). So we need such clk/instructions below assemble codes to complete the whole cycle. Lack for branch instruction, so we have to repeat similar instructions to calculate 4 cycles. 1234567891011121314load rd1, rs, 1load rd2, rs, 2load rd3, rs, 3load rd4, rs, 4load rd5, rs, 5load rd6, rs, 6load rd7, rs, 7load rd8, rs, 8mac rd , 0 , /, 1mac rd , rd1, rd2,0mac rd , rd3, rd4,0mac rd , rd5, rd6,0mac rd , rd7, rd8,0store / , rs , rd At first, we split three 8•8 matric into 24 vectors which has 8 impolements. input vector 1234567891011121314load rd1, rs, 1 load rd2, rs, 2 load rd3, rs, 3 load rd4, rs, 4 load rd5, rs, 5 load rd6, rs, 6 load rd7, rs, 7 load rd8, rs, 8 mac rd , 0 , /, 1 mac rd , rd1, rd2,0 mac rd , rd3, rd4,0 mac rd , rd5, rd6,0 mac rd , rd7, rd8,0 store / , rs , rd As showed in picture waveform, testdata was stored in Dmem at the beginning , after 4 cycles calculation, dmem was put in 10, 30, 11, 8 one by one (Display in hexadecimal).
